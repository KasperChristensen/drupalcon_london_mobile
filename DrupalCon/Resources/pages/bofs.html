  <p class="first">Birds of a Feather (or BoF) sessions  allow ad-hoc groups to
    meet and discuss issues that may have a more narrow interest than regular
    conference sessions, or get together as a group of like-minded individuals
    to talk about common problems.  Some BoFs are run as moderated discussions.
    Some are shared work sessions where everyone brings their computer and helps
    each other out. Others are more presentation or panel-discussion style. It's
    really up to whoever is planning the BoF to choose the topic and the format.</p>

  <p>Birds of a Feather (BoF) rooms are open at the same times as normal sessions held at Fairfield Halls from Tuesday 23rd August until Thursday 25th August.</p>
  <p>BoF sessions can be scheduled electronically. To schedule a BoF, or to see what BoFs have
    already been scheduled, visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://london2011.drupal.org/conference/bofs">DrupalCon website.</a></p>
